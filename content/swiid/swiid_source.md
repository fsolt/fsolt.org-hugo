## The SWIID Source Data

[The SWIID's income inequality estimates](http://fsolt.org/swiid/swiid_downloads.html) are based on [thousands of reported Gini indices from hundreds of published sources](https://fsolt.org/blog/2017/07/28/the-swiid-source-data.html).  To explore these source data, choose a country; click on a series in the plot to display only that series in the table.  Links to the original sources can be found in the table.  The entire source dataset is also [available as a spreadsheet](https://github.com/fsolt/swiid/blob/master/data/swiid_source.csv).
